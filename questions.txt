1. Where does React put all the elements I create in JSX
when I call 'root.render()' ?
...
The elements I render get put in the element with the id of "root"
...

2. What would show up in my console if I were to run this line of code:

console.log(<h1>Hello World!</h1>) ?
...
It'll show an object
...

3. What's wrong with this code :

root.render(
    <h1>Hi there</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
...
When you render, you must have only one parent elemant
...

4. What dooes it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative" ?
...
When somethind is "declarative" we only have to say what the code is going to do
while when it is "imperative", we have to say how the code is going to work
...

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable" ?
...
We have small pieces that we can put together to make something larger and
greater than the individual pieces themselves
...
